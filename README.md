# js-enemy-movement

Project Overview:
Demonstrates animations and enemies, allows user to choose animation and to choose enemy

What I learned:
Expanded knowledge on using a class to store properties of objects, in this case an Enemy
Used Math methods to simulate angular movement
How to simulate different types of animation

Future development:
Implement choosing animation type (if statements for each type, implement calculation based on type)
Allow user to change certain values based on animation type (angle, interval, speed, etc.)
Experiment with using local JSON for data instead of array in scripts.js

Tips for future me:
Small performance boost by using ++x instead of x++, and multiplying by 1/x is faster than dividing by x (e.x. x\*.5 better than x/2)
